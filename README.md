# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Overview

This week’s challenge required me to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters.
